# Simulation Training and Control System (STACS) for Bridge Inspection

A Department of Computer Science and Engineering CS426 Senior Project for the College of Engineering at University of Nevada, Reno (UNR).

The Simulation Training and Control Systems (STACS) is a simulation software initially developed by the Evolutionary Computing Systems Lab (ECSL) that allows users to operate steel bridge inspection robots produced by the Advanced Robotics and Automation (ARA) Laboratory at UNR. Learning to operate robots in a simulated environment is important because it will help users understand how to resolve special circumstances, prevent damage to expensive equipment, and extend autonomous robotics research and development. Our team is extending existing STACS software with three major features. The first feature is a sandbox/bridge creator mode which will let the user construct unique scenarios. The second feature is training mode which will give guidance to the operator. The last feature is a testing mode which will evaluate the operators performance.

## Installation

### In Windows
1. Download Unity version 2018.4.19f1 (best if managed through [Unity Hub](https://public-cdn.cloud.unity3d.com/hub/prod/UnityHubSetup.exe))
2. Download this repository using git (on Windows use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) or [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on Linux)
3. Open the project in Unity 2018.4.19.f1
4. If prompted for update Unity project version choose no (for version consistency)
5. Select the scenes folder in (Assets -> Senior Projects Extensions) and click on a scene file to open the latest progress
