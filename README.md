# Stacs

Simulation Training and Control System (STACS) for multi-robot bridge inspection. 

A training simulation for monitoring and controlling multiple simulated robots IS the real thing when hooked up to real robots. Stacs implements a training simulation, in Unity, for multi-robot bridge inspection and through a simple ROS bridge, monitors and controls real robots.
